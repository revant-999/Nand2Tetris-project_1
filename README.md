🖥️ Nand2Tetris

This repository documents my journey of building a complete computer system from the ground up, following the Nand2Tetris course. Starting with nothing but the NAND gate, each layer of hardware and software is constructed step by step until a fully working computer and operating system emerge.

🔧 Implemented Layers

Boolean Logic

Arithmetic Circuits

Sequential Logic

Memory Architecture

Machine Language

Assembler & Virtual Machine

High-Level Language & OS

🧠 Key Idea

The computer is built using a bottom-up approach:

Start from NAND → Logic Gates

Build Arithmetic + Memory

Create a CPU + Machine Language

End with a high-level language & OS

📂 File Organization

Project1/ → Boolean Logic

Project2/ → Arithmetic

Project3/ → Sequential Logic

(and so on...)

✅ Testing

All hardware and software modules are tested using the Nand2Tetris tools (Hardware Simulator, CPU Emulator, VM Emulator).
