This project is the first step of the Nand2Tetris journey, where I implemented a complete set of logic gates—NOT, AND, OR, XOR, MUX, DMUX, and their 16-bit and multi-way variants—using only NAND gates in Hardware Description Language (HDL). The work demonstrates how complex digital circuits can be systematically built from a single primitive, moving from elementary gates to multi-bit and multi-way abstractions. All implementations were tested using the Nand2Tetris hardware simulator and verified against provided test scripts, ensuring correctness. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with digital logic design, hardware abstraction, and the bottom-up process of constructing computing systems starting from the most fundamental building block.
